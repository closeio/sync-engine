class CrispinClient:
    """
    Generic IMAP client wrapper.

    Generally, crispin client calls operate on the currently selected folder.
    There are some specific calls which may change the selected folder as a
    part of their work and may leave it selected at the end of the call, since
    folder selects are expensive in IMAP. These methods are called out in
    their docstrings.

    IMAP only guarantees that folder message UIDs are valid for a "session",
    which is defined as from the time you SELECT a folder until the connection
    is closed or another folder is selected.

    Crispin clients *always* return ints rather than strings for number
    data types, such as message UIDs, Google message IDs, and Google thread
    IDs.

    All inputs are coerced to strings before being passed off to the IMAPClient
    connection.

    You should really be interfacing with this class via a connection pool,
    see `connection_pool()`.

    account_id : int
