"""
Helper functions for actions that operate on accounts.

These could be methods of ImapAccount, but separating them gives us more
flexibility with calling code, as most don't need any attributes of the account
object other than the ID, to limit the action.

Types returned for data are the column types defined via SQLAlchemy.

Eventually we're going to want a better way of ACLing functions that operate on
accounts.
