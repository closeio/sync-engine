# TODO(menno) - It's good to have all servers use UTC for general
# sanity, but the IMAPClient concern mentioned in the warning text
# below can be avoided. When an IMAPClient instance's
# `normalise_times` attribute is set to False IMAPClient will return
# unnormalised, timezone-aware timestamps. Changing this is probably
# non-trival because timezone and non-timezone-aware timestamps don't
# mix. Some care will be required to ensure that only timezone-aware
# timestamps are used where they might mix with timestamps originating
# from IMAPClient.

System time is not set to UTC! This is a problem because
